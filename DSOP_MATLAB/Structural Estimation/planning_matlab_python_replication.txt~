Planning:

A temporary planning file for aligning Matlab and Python code.

Steps to take:

    1.  Identify parameters used for current Matlab Structural Estimation model.
    
    2.  Output these parameters from the Matlab file, into csv or similar file. 
        Important to ge the exact values from Matlab -- don't allow for human 
        error entering first-pass of replication. 
        
    3.  Put all correct values into "Python" JSON file.
    
    4.  Run the Matlab and Python versions of the objective functions for a small select set of values: 
        the optimum,   a few values around the optimum,   and a few values far away from the optimum. 
        
    5.  As needed, search for differences between the Matlab code and the Python code. 
    
    6.  Work on a Matlab "read_parameters_from_json.m" file, as in the Python version, 
        to read parameter values from the same JSON file as the Python version does. 

    7.  Repeat step (4) above: show that the JSON-parameterized Matlab and Python 
        create the same output values for select paramter combinations.

ID paramters by working through this file:

    EstimateRhoAndBetahat.m
    
> which indicates:

    setup_everything.m 
        
>> which indicates:

    setup_params
    setup_functions
    setup_grid_eee
    setup_shocks

Once we are back in EstimateRhoAndBetahat.m, we encounter:

    setup_GList;                        % Load GList
    setup_Betacorr;                     % Load corrected beta
    NumOfPeriodsToSimulate = 90-55+1;   % Length of life in simulation (simulate until age 60)
    NumOfPeople            = 10000;      % Number of people to simulate
    NumOfPeopleBootstrap   = 10000;      % Number of people to simulate in bootstopping process
    NumOfBootstrap         = 30;        % Number of times to iterate bootstapping process
    setup_shocksLists                   % Set up shock lists
    % Estimation
    Data_SCF_wealth                          % Load data

Notes on setup_GList.m:

    -   Three values in here:
            - Incomec
            - IncomeLevelc
            - GList
            
        Need to confirm that only GList is used outside this context...
        CONFIRMED. grep shows that only the "GList" value shows up later in the 
        code. 


    -   May want to include this small bit of Matlab code in the "Paramters" 
        directory, such that anyone can reproduce this GList if they want. 

    -   Need to more generally ask Chris about how he'd like to handle the 
        "parameterization"/"calibration" portion of choosing all these 
        structural values.
    


Notes on setup_shocks.m:

    -   These are the structures created by this file (all others are deleted):

            -   ThetaMat
            -   ThetaVecRetireProb
            -   ThetaMatProb
            -   PermMat
            -   PermVecProb

        This is a good place to look if we find problems with replication.


    -   IMPORTANT NOTE:
    
            -   The Matlab code has both *retirement* and *non-retirement*
                individuals facing uncertainty from a lognormal distribution --
                which **may** change in retirement years vs outside of retire
                years, due to the values of SIGMATran(i) changing. 
                In the Matlab code, the values post-retirement appear to drop very low
                BUT, this 
                appears to be reasonably different from Python setup, which assumes
                that the *only* uncertainty past a certain age is due to 
                the single possible zero-shock to retirement income; otherwise 
                all income "frozen" at the last shock values before retirement. 
                
                **This is important key point here.**
    
                Will need to add to Python code, a "switch" which allows us to 
                determine whether retirement income has "full uncertainty" or
                "zero-shock-only" uncertainty. 
                **NEED TO ADD.** This will definitely change whether code 
                matches.
      
      
    *   MORE important notes, related to variance over the life cycle:

            -   In   setup_shocks.m, it appears as though the SIGMATran and 
                SIGMAPerm shocks appear to be  **in reverse order**. 
                That is, the 25 values of "very low" variance shocks are at
                the end. 25 years is the length of retirement (with 40 being 
                length of working years). In the past we've talked about shocks
                to *retirement* income being very low -- here, the shocks to the 
                first 25 years of working life are very low, and grow quite a 
                lot in the 26th-65th years.
                Recall that the model is written with a "Tminust" timing -- that
                is, the first index indicates the next-to-last period, etc. (The
                "0" period indicates the final period. This actually lets us 
                somewhat match the Python code against the Matlab code with
                respect to timing and indices -- in Matlab code, simple don't 
                include the final period values in all vectors, and i=1 -> T-1,
                while in Python, i=0 -> T). 
    
                Regardless, we will confirm this when we run the two codes 
                against one another. 
                
                Perhaps it is the case that some indexing later in the code 
                mitigates this concern.
                
                
                NOTE that the line:
                
                    ThetaMatProb = [repmat(ThetaVecProb,PeriodsToSolve-(90-65),1);repmat(ThetaVecRetireProb,90-65,1)];
                
                is at least consistent with the SIGMATran and SIGMAPerm values
                being ordered with the youth first and retirement second. 
                
                Will need to see how this is used in the code. 
                
                
    *   We will need to be very careful about the timing of the approximated
        shock distributions and how they are used in the code. 
        
        The parameterization is going to be extremely important to get correct 
        here. If the Matlab code "reverses" the timing references to all the 
        income shock values, we can't "simply" use the same input vectors for 
        each. We'll need to reverse the input SIGMATran and SIGMAPerm vectors
        in either Matlab or Python's JSON "read-in" functions (if both reading
        from the same JSON file.)
        
    *   Generally: we will need to be careful that the "vector values" fed into 
        the JSON file contain -- or don't contain -- a final T period value, \
        "appropriately." The Python code, I think will include a final-T value
        for i=0, while the Matlab (and perhaps Mathematica) code, and any other
        with 1-indexed structures, will not include functions or values for the
        final T period. This will let us "align" different-indexed code types. 


Notes on setup_params.m:

    -   Need to work out how the "WeightedSumDist.m" file uses "pi" from end of 
        "setup_params.m" to create the weighted sum for the "model_error" 
        function. Python code does it a little differently, and likely more 
        effciently. 
        

Notes on  setup_functions.m:
    -   No params set (just inline funcitons)

Notes on  setup_grid_eee.m:

    -   Need to confirm that the code here does the exact same thing as the more 
        general Python code  (which was stolen straight from the more-general 
        Matlab code from the MicroDSOP notes code).
