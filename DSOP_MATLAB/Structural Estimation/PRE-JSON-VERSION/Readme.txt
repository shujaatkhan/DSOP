0.  Note: You must run "doall.m" first before the EstimateRhoAndBetahat.m file 
    will run. In addition, to use the JSON load function, you need to download 
    the "jsonlab" toolbox from the mathworks matlabcentral website, here:
    
        http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files-in-matlab-octave
        
    Download the latest version of the jsonlab zip file.
    Unzip the file (use "unzip -a downloaded_file_name.zip" for Linux) and place 
    it in your MATLAB toolbox directory. 
    Finally, open MATLAB and add the "jsonlab" directory, inside the toolbox 
    directory, to the MATLAB path (or take equivalent steps in Octave).


1.  Running EstimateRhoAndBetahat.m gives joint estimates of Rho and Betahat, 
    using data on wealth / permanent income ratio (of college graduates) in SCF.
    It takes about 10 minutes to obtain estimates of Rho and Betahat on a 
    1700 Mhz Pentium M-class laptop computer using 1000 agents. (Time needed to 
    obtain standard errors depends on the number of estimation in the 
    bootstrapping process.)
    Note that increasing the agents to around 10000 (the default value) will 
    take 45-60 min. 

2.  Running plotWealthPermIncRatio.m plots wealth / permanent income ratio in 
    SCF (both means and medians).

3.  Running 
        - plotFigA1_ProbOfALive.m plots list of income growth factors
        - plotFigA2_Beta.m plots list of time-variant discount factors
        - plotFigA3_G.m plots list of probabilities of being alive
