Values set up in the initial steps:


One first-pass step is to simply use the Matlab code to *create* the JSON file
which we want to use for the Python code. 

So track two things as I work through all of the setup code:

    1.  the place and name of everything which is defined *in* the matlab code, which is also in JSOn file
    
    2.  any things defined in the Matlab code which is *not* used in the JSON / Python file.



Slowly working through all setup files:
