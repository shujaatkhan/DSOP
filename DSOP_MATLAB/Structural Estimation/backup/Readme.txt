This folder contains programs which produce figures and results in "Structural Estimation" section. 

0. Note: must run "doall.m" first before the EstimateRhoAndBetahat.m file will run.

1. Running EstimateRhoAndBetahat.m gives joint estimates of Rho and Betahat, using data on wealth / permanent income ratio (of college graduates) in SCF.
   It takes about 10 minutes to obtain estimates of Rho and Betahat on a 1700 Mhz Pentium M-class laptop computer. (Time needed to obtain standard errors depends on the number of estimation in the bootstrapping process.)

2. Running plotWealthPermIncRatio.m plots wealth / permanent income ratio in SCF (both means and medians)

3. Running 
 - plotFigA1_ProbOfALive.m plots list of income growth factors
 - plotFigA2_Beta.m plots list of time-variant discount factors
 - plotFigA3_G.m plots list of probabilities of being alive
